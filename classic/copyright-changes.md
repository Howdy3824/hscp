# Changes made to comply with [NESA Copyright Policy][]
On 15 June 2018, I was contacted by NESA informing me that HSCPastPapers.com
breached [NESA Copyright Policy][], which states:
> No part of the Material may be reproduced in Australia or in any other country
> by any process, electronic or otherwise, in any material form, or transmitted
> to any other person or stored electronically in any form without the prior
> written permission of NESA

On further clarification, it was stated that it is a principle “that the HSC
Examination papers should only appear on the NESA website”.

It should be noted that HSCPastPapers.com never stored any NESA documents or
made copies of these documents – this can be easily seen when viewing the source
code, which has always been publicly available on GitHub:
https://github.com/notseenee/hscpastpapers

As such, HSCPastPapers.com will no longer embed PDF files from NESA’s website:

Instead, it will only link to the PDF file and will open it automatically in a
new tab to keep the web app fast and easy to use.

I created HSCPastPapers.com to provide a better experience for students when
accessing HSC past papers. While the web app has been somewhat neutered as a
result of this change, I believe it still improves the experience of browsing
for HSC past papers, especially with its keyboard-navigable interface. As such,
I will keep this web app available indefinitely.
